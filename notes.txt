How to orchestrate the FXs:

* time - global time used by orchestrator to orchestrate the different
  parts / FXs. The time is updated every 64 frames, i.e every 1.28
  second. Therefore the duration of the demo can be up to 54.4
  minutes. The main selector select the FXs to play according to this
  time.

* The demo will be cut in parts:
  - intro: Text only - Flush presents ...
  - credits: Text only
  - beers_part: turned objects + Text (slow)
  - greetz: turned object + Test(fast)

Each part will configure the different FX parts

* Intro (initial setup):
  - Layout = text-only
  - Text_ptr = Flush
  - Speed = 4

* Credits:
  - Speed = 2

* Beers:
  - Layout = turn-text
  - speed = 8

* Greetz:
  - speed = 1
